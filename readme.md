<h3> Project Overview </h3>

This project is a sophisticated website designed to showcase the stunning capabilities of animations created using the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP). By leveraging key GSAP components such as Timeline and ScrollTrigger, the website delivers a captivating user experience marked by fluid and engaging animations.

<h3> Design and User Interface </h3>

The website features a minimalist design, emphasizing simplicity and elegance. This clean and uncluttered aesthetic ensures that the focus remains on the animations themselves, highlighting their beauty and complexity. The intuitive interface provides users with a seamless browsing experience, making it easy to navigate and appreciate the animations on display.

<h3> Page Structure and Animation Triggers </h3>

The project comprises two distinct pages, each meticulously designed to load animations upon entry. When a user visits or reloads the website, the animations for the respective page are initiated, providing a dynamic and interactive experience from the moment they arrive.

<h3> GSAP Timeline </h3>

The GSAP Timeline component is utilized to choreograph the animations, allowing for precise control over the timing and sequencing of each element. This ensures a smooth and cohesive flow of animations, enhancing the overall visual appeal and user engagement.

<h3> GSAP ScrollTrigger </h3>

In addition to Timeline, the GSAP ScrollTrigger component plays a crucial role in the website's interactivity. ScrollTrigger enables animations to be tied to the user's scroll behavior, creating an immersive experience where animations respond dynamically as the user scrolls through the content. This adds a layer of depth and interactivity, making the browsing experience more engaging and enjoyable.
